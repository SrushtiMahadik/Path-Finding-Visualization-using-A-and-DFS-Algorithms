# Path-Finding Visualization using A* and DFS Algorithms

This project visualizes how A* and DFS pathfinding algorithms navigate a grid with obstacles to reach a goal. Using Python and Matplotlib, it simulates a 10×10 grid where users can observe real-time algorithm traversal, compare efficiency, and analyze how heuristic-based and uninformed search methods behave. The project provides an interactive learning tool for understanding AI search algorithms used in robotics, navigation, and game development.
